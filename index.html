    <h3>8/25/2023 - First Journal Entry</h3>
    <p>This past week, we have been learning how to set up our websites through AWS. After we created our websites, we started to work on actually designing our websites by using html commands on our own. On August 25, we were shown slides about safety and the basic cycle of engineering. After the slides, we did an activity involving marbles and pipes where we attempted to put a marble in a bucket. My team failed as we lacked communication and someone who could really lead us. There was no set method that we were going to take so we were all lost. The lack of a leader who should have had figured out a good plan to do throughout this activity was a fatal flaw in our group, resulting in our failure to complete the activity.</p>
    
    <h3>9/11/2023 - Rube Goldberg Design & CAD</h3>
    <p>During last week, we started to CAD our designs of our own Rube Goldberg Designs. We had practice on how to use TinkerCad and now we are able to create our own designs. We started working on actually making our Rube Goldberg projects using cardboard, although we weren't able to get much done. At first, we didn't know how to use the measurements on the TinkerCad, but we decided to use millimeters as centimeters and then cut the measurements in half in order to reduce the size of our project. I would like to keep working on it this week to really make sure that the structure will be sturdy enough to perform all of the simple machines.</p>
