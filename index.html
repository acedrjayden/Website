    <h3>8/25/2023 - First Journal Entry</h3>
    <p>This past week, we have been learning how to set up our websites through AWS. After we created our websites, we started to work on actually designing our websites by using html commands on our own. On August 25, we were shown slides about safety and the basic cycle of engineering. After the slides, we did an activity involving marbles and pipes where we attempted to put a marble in a bucket. My team failed as we lacked communication and someone who could really lead us. There was no set method that we were going to take so we were all lost. The lack of a leader who should have had figured out a good plan to do throughout this activity was a fatal flaw in our group, resulting in our failure to complete the activity.</p>
    
    <h3>9/11/2023 - Rube Goldberg Design & CAD</h3>
    <p>During last week, we started to CAD our designs of our own Rube Goldberg Designs. We had practice on how to use TinkerCad and now we are able to create our own designs. We started working on actually making our Rube Goldberg projects using cardboard, although we weren't able to get much done. At first, we didn't know how to use the measurements on the TinkerCad, but we decided to use millimeters as centimeters and then cut the measurements in half in order to reduce the size of our project. I would like to keep working on it this week to really make sure that the structure will be sturdy enough to perform all of the simple machines.</p>

    <h3>9/15/2023 - First Official Test of Rube Goldberg Machine</h3>
    <p>During this week, we have been workin on our Rube Goldberg Machines and my group was able to finish it today, September 15, 2023. Initially, we had problems where the needle would hit the balloon, but it wouldn't pop it. We suspected that it was because there was not enough force generated from the pendulum, so we looked around our machine to see what we could do to increase the force. We discovered that the opening where the baseball had to go through to hit the lever/balance was small enough so that the baseball was able to grow through, but the ball would slow down. So, we cut it out more in order to reduce the friction exerted from the wall to the baseball. This helped to generate enough force, but now we were faced with the problem with the inaccuracy and unpredictable tendency of our machine. The object on the pendulum swing would constantly rotate, being unable to hit the balloon almost all of the time. As we tried to solve the problem, we decided to use two strings on the object to reduce how much the object swung to the left and right, allowing it to go straight into the balloon. We also added a small box to the back of the balloon to serve as a support for the balloon to lean on. After all these minor adjustments, we were able to successfully pop the balloon at the end.</p>
    <p>After we were able to complete our final draft of our Rube Goldberg Machine, it made me realize the importance of testing everything to make sure that everything was working correctly. In addition, I now know how it takes multiple adjustments to anything to improve it. Anything can be improved, even with small, minor adjustments.</p>

    <h3>9/29/2023 - Computer Dissection</h3>
    <p>During this week, we worked on learning about the differnt components of a Personal Computer(PC), and to actually dissect one. We dissected the computers while looking at instructions on a slide on our own pace. After we finished dissecting and identifying the parts of the computer, we had to put everything back together to see if they would work. It was a little difficult to put everything together, but we were able to put it back together in the end after looking at pictures of what it was supposed to look at. After we put back a computer, we need to see if we did it correctly in order to see if we put everything in the right places. Our computer was able to turn on and it had a green light on, indicating that it was working.</p>
    <p>Two days after we dissected the computers, we received a worksheet to color in some of the parts of the computer. It was a bit difficult because the graphics and the overall image quality was bad, but I was able to finish mine after around 20 minutes. </p>

    <h3>10/4/2023 - Prosthetic Hand</h3>
    <p>Today, we worked on making a prosthetic hand out of cardboard, string, duck tape, and rubber bands. After finishing the bioengineering slides, we worked on making a prosthetic hand of our own. Our goal was to pick up an empty plastic water bottle using just the prosthetic hand. We were able to create a prosthetic hand that is similar to a gauntlet by using duck tape, cardboard, and rubber bands. Initially, I created tendons on the back of the hand so that the prosthetic hand would function like a real human hand. After adding tendons, we realized that they served no purpose to the hand. So we decided not to add the tendons. After this, we worked to keep the hand from destroying itself because the cardboard would keep bending from the rubber bands pulling on it. In order counter this, we cut the cardboard so that the lines did not bend in the same way as the rubber went. This allowed for the fingers to not get destroyed whenever we tried to use it. In the end, we were able to pick up the water bottle by only using the prosthetic arm.</p>
