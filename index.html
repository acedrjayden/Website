    <h3>8/25/2023 - First Journal Entry</h3>
    <p>This past week, we have been learning how to set up our websites through AWS. After we created our websites, we started to work on actually designing our websites by using html commands on our own. On August 25, we were shown slides about safety and the basic cycle of engineering. After the slides, we did an activity involving marbles and pipes where we attempted to put a marble in a bucket. My team failed as we lacked communication and someone who could really lead us. There was no set method that we were going to take so we were all lost. The lack of a leader who should have had figured out a good plan to do throughout this activity was a fatal flaw in our group, resulting in our failure to complete the activity.</p>
    
    <h3>9/11/2023 - Rube Goldberg Design & CAD</h3>
    <p>During last week, we started to CAD our designs of our own Rube Goldberg Designs. We had practice on how to use TinkerCad and now we are able to create our own designs. We started working on actually making our Rube Goldberg projects using cardboard, although we weren't able to get much done. At first, we didn't know how to use the measurements on the TinkerCad, but we decided to use millimeters as centimeters and then cut the measurements in half in order to reduce the size of our project. I would like to keep working on it this week to really make sure that the structure will be sturdy enough to perform all of the simple machines.</p>

    <h3>9/15/2023 - First Official Test of Rube Goldberg Machine</h3>
    <p>During this week, we have been workin on our Rube Goldberg Machines and my group was able to finish it today, September 15, 2023. Initially, we had problems where the needle would hit the balloon, but it wouldn't pop it. We suspected that it was because there was not enough force generated from the pendulum, so we looked around our machine to see what we could do to increase the force. We discovered that the opening where the baseball had to go through to hit the lever/balance was small enough so that the baseball was able to grow through, but the ball would slow down. So, we cut it out more in order to reduce the friction exerted from the wall to the baseball. This helped to generate enough force, but now we were faced with the problem with the inaccuracy and unpredictable tendency of our machine. The object on the pendulum swing would constantly rotate, being unable to hit the balloon almost all of the time. As we tried to solve the problem, we decided to use two strings on the object to reduce how much the object swung to the left and right, allowing it to go straight into the balloon. We also added a small box to the back of the balloon to serve as a support for the balloon to lean on. After all these minor adjustments, we were able to successfully pop the balloon at the end.</p>
    <p>After we were able to complete our final draft of our Rube Goldberg Machine, it made me realize the importance of testing everything to make sure that everything was working correctly. In addition, I now know how it takes multiple adjustments to anything to improve it. Anything can be improved, even with small, minor adjustments.</p>

    <h3>9/29/2023 - Computer Dissection</h3>
    <p>During this week, we worked on learning about the differnt components of a Personal Computer(PC), and to actually dissect one. We dissected the computers while looking at instructions on a slide on our own pace. After we finished dissecting and identifying the parts of the computer, we had to put everything back together to see if they would work. It was a little difficult to put everything together, but we were able to put it back together in the end after looking at pictures of what it was supposed to look at. After we put back a computer, we need to see if we did it correctly in order to see if we put everything in the right places. Our computer was able to turn on and it had a green light on, indicating that it was working.</p>
    <p>Two days after we dissected the computers, we received a worksheet to color in some of the parts of the computer. It was a bit difficult because the graphics and the overall image quality was bad, but I was able to finish mine after around 20 minutes. </p>

    <h3>10/4/2023 - Prosthetic Hand</h3>
    <p>Today, we worked on making a prosthetic hand out of cardboard, string, duck tape, and rubber bands. After finishing the bioengineering slides, we worked on making a prosthetic hand of our own. Our goal was to pick up an empty plastic water bottle using just the prosthetic hand. We were able to create a prosthetic hand that is similar to a gauntlet by using duck tape, cardboard, and rubber bands. Initially, I created tendons on the back of the hand so that the prosthetic hand would function like a real human hand. After adding tendons, we realized that they served no purpose to the hand. So we decided not to add the tendons. After this, we worked to keep the hand from destroying itself because the cardboard would keep bending from the rubber bands pulling on it. In order counter this, we cut the cardboard so that the lines did not bend in the same way as the rubber went. This allowed for the fingers to not get destroyed whenever we tried to use it. In the end, we were able to pick up the water bottle by only using the prosthetic arm.</p>

    <h3>10/20/2023 - Bottle Rocket</h3>
    <p>This week, we worked on building our own bottle rockets using 2 liter soda bottles, cardboard, tape, hotglue, and pencils. We learned about Aerospace Engineering this week, and this was a topic that was particularly interesting to me because it is the field of my interest. It was cool seeing the different types of engineering that involved physics, and it was especially intersting when we watched videos of actual rockets that were launched, whether they failed or succeeded. After learning about rocket and the forces that act upon it, we immediately went to CAD our models of our bottle rockets. At first, my group had a problem with our design because we didn't know how to desgin our rockets. After a while, we decided on a simple desgin.</p>
    <p>After we finished designing our Bottle Rockets on TinkerCad, we started building our rockets using the bottles that we brought. My groupmates and I forgot to bring our bottles so we needed to use one that was in the classroom. Although it took us a while to design our rockets on TinkerCad, we were able to finsish building our rocket really fast. It was pretty simple too, so it wasn't going to take a while. In order to build the rocket, we got four pieces of cardboard to build the wings/flappers on the side of the rocket to help it to fly straight. But, after cutting out the first wing, we discovered that it was really weak because of how we cut it against the cardboard. In order to fix this problems, we cut it the other direction. In addition, we put tape on the wings so that it would be more aerodynamic. After this, we worked on building the cone of the rocket so it would be even more aerodynamic. The cone was initially built using cardboard, but we noticed how it made the rocket really heavy, and it was really difficult to make shape the cardboard into a cone. So, we decided to make the cone using paper to reduce the weight of the rocket, as well as have a cone that was really aerodynamic. Finally, with all of the parts made, we hot-glued all of the parts on to the rocket. For fun, we even added the Coca Cola logo from the bottle as a flag for our "sponsers".</p>
    <p>Since the rockets were finally built, we just needed to wait until the day we were actually going to try to launch the rocket into the air to see how far it was going to fly. On October 20, 2023, we went outside to finally test our bottle rockets. On this day, we filled our rockets up with water because it was going to the be the fuel for our thrust in order to propel the rocket through the air. My group decided to fill a third of the rocket with water because we thought it was preferable to have more fuel for the rocket to fly farther. We angled our rocket high so that it could fly farther up in the air. When our rocket was launched into the air, we discovered that it would twirl around and it immediately went straight into the ground and moved further like a car. On the initial flight, the rocket flew pretty far, and we were pretty satisfied. As a result, we decided to anlge the rocket as flat as we could in order to let it fly in the horizontal direction as far as it could, but I believe the initial launch was better because on the second launch, our rocket was really damaged, already losing the pencil on the bottom as well as a wing. Overall, I thought this was a fun activity that did not take as long as the Goldberg Machine and I would like to do more engineering projects like this again.</p>

    <h3>10/26/2023 - Water Filter</h3>
    <p>During this week, we learned about the topic of Environmental Engineering. Environmental Engineering is pretty self explanatory, so we started working on building something right away. On October 26, 2023, we started building our own water filters using bottles, rocks, pebbles, sand, and cotton balls. Our goal was to turn the dirty water consisting of a lot of wood and dirt, into clean, clear water that would be drinkable. Of course, we did not want to actually drink the filtered water, but it had the same concept. My group decided to put the cotton balls first so that the water would be filtered in the end, and put everything from largest to smallest so that there would not be a lot of space for the dirty components of the water to pass through. In the end, our water was not really clean once we tried to filter it, but it was a lot cleaner from when it first started. We believe that it was because of the cotton ball at the end because it was really dirty. No matter how many times we would filter it, the water always turned out to be brownish. We determined that the problem may have been the cotton filter that turned brown, changing the water at the end into a brownish color. In the end, we could only make the water a little clear with a hint of brown due to the brown cotton filter.</p>
